My first project built using react. The CV builder relies heavily on state variables to continuously update the output generated. Different components were
built for different sections of the form to make the project more maintainable. To make this work, state variables and functions were passed into the
react components as arguments and then accessed using the props syntax. The uuid package allows the CV builder to create random id values for use as react 
keys. The react hook form package allows for easy resetting and editing of the forms. The application also used the bootstrap library for improved styling.
